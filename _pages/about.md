I'm SoonXueyuer, a full-time undergraduate student majoring in Information Security at Jiangxi University of Science and Technology. My academic exploration in this field started from a strong interest in cybersecurity mechanisms, data protection, and the ever-changing landscape of digital threats.
At Jiangxi University of Science and Technology, I'm currently diving into core subjects like Cryptography, Information Warfare, and Operating System Security. I'm especially into ethical hacking and vulnerability assessment because they bridge theoretical knowledge with real-world problem-solving. Outside of classes, I keep up with industry trends through platforms like the National Vulnerability Database (CNVD) and join online cybersecurity competitions to level up my skills.
I'm also studying programming languages such as Python and C/C++, which I use to develop small-scale security tools and analyze potential system vulnerabilities. My goal is to contribute to safeguarding information security, and I hope to explore areas like cloud security threat detection in future studies.
